## v1.0 for OneUI 7 Changelog

This update is designed for OneUI 7 and includes crucial improvements and new features for the camera app.

- Removed QHD modes due to incompatibilities with OneUI 7.
- Added advanced zero shutter lag support.
- Added support for additional scene detection effects like Bright Night and Document Scan.
- Added support for the zoom rocker feature in video mode, allowing for smoother zoom adjustments during video recording. This works with UW too and may seem weird, but it's a feature that some users may find useful.

*Note: This update is specifically tailored for OneUI 7 and the module will not flash on OneUI 6 or earlier versions. Ensure your device is running OneUI 7 before applying this update.*

Enjoy :)
